This is a lot. Could generate simple synthetic patterns: weight increase to adulthood then stable/decline; height increase to adulthood then stable; menopause at age 51 (value 1 after). Hormonal contraception for non-menopausal: maybe 0 or -1. Pregnancy: for ages during childbearing: maybe 3 (previously pregnant) after having child.\n\nSimplify: assign constant values for many biomarkers within normal ranges, with slight age trends (e.g., glucose slight increase with age, creatinine slight increase, eGFR decline). But generating for each age manually would be huge. However we can produce rows for each age up to maybe 85. That\'s 86 rows. That\'s a lot but doable.\n\nWe need to produce numeric values each row, must be realistic but can be approximated.\n\nWe need to produce a CSV with header line then rows.\n\nApproach: Write a script mentally? Too many rows.\n\nMaybe we can limit death age to 70 to reduce rows. Age 0 to 70 inclusive = 71 rows. Still many.\n\nWe need to output manually; but as ChatGPT we can generate pattern by describing formulas but must output actual numbers.\n\nWe can generate simple linear interpolation formulas and compute values for each age using mental approximations? That\'s tedious.\n\nAlternative: Provide fewer rows? But must be realistic death age; could be 30? That would be unrealistic but allowed? "based on realistic life expectancy, e.g., 70-100 years." It says choose dying age based on real distribution; we should pick maybe 78.\n\nThus need many rows.\n\nGiven time constraints, we can produce a truncated dataset with key ages? But the instruction says each subsequent row must increment age by 1, and continue until death age. So must have consecutive rows.\n\nWe could generate rows with same values for many biomarkers across ages; that\'s acceptable as numeric. Use simple rule: for each age, weight = 3.5 + age*0.5 up to 20, then stable. But we need to compute each row.\n\nMaybe we can produce a CSV with ages 0-85 but use approximate formulas and generate values programmatically mentally? Could approximate with simple patterns:\n\nLet\'s define functions:\n\nWeight (kg):\n- 0-2: 3.5 + age*2 (so 0:3.5,1:5.5,2:7.5)\n- 3-12: 7.5 + age*2 (3:13.5,4:15.5,...12:31.5)\n- 13-18: 31.5 + (age-12)*5 (13:36.5,...18:61.5)\n- 19-30: 61.5 + (age-18)*0.5 (19:62.5,...30:68.0)\n- 31-70: 68 + (age-30)*0.2 (31:68.2,...70:78)\n\nHeight (cm):\n- 0:50\n- 1:55\n- 2:60\n- 3:65\n- 4:70\n- 5:105? unrealistic. Let\'s use more realistic: Height grows to 170 by age 18.\nSimplify: height = 50 + age*6 for age<=10 (0:50,10:110). Then for 11-18: height = 110 + (age-10)*7 (11:117,18:159). After 18: height = 165 constant.\n\nMenopause: -1 before 45, 0 for 45-50 maybe, 1 after 51. We\'ll set: age<45 => -1, age 45-50 => 0, age>=51 => 1.\n\nHormonal_contraception: for non-menopausal (age<45), assume 1 (yes) for 20-35 else -1. We\'ll set: if age between 20-35 =>1 else -1. For menopausal or unknown =>0.\n\nPregnancy: categories: currently pregnant (1), planning (2), previously pregnant (3), not applicable (4), prefer not (0). Since she had 1 child, we can set previously pregnant (3) for ages after 20 onward. For ages < 15 =>0. So we can set: age<15 =>0, age>=15 =>3.\n\nBiomarkers: We\'ll assign baseline normal values with slight age trends.\n\nSimplify: Use constants for most, with some variation:\n\nglucose: start 4.0 at age 0, increase 0.01 per year => age*0.01 +4.0. At age 70 => 5.7.\n\ninsulin: 5 + age*0.05 (max 20). At age 70 => 8.5.\n\nhba1c: 4.5 + age*0.02 (max 6). Age70 => 5.9.\n\nhemoglobin: 13 + (age-30)*0.02 (decline after 30) - but keep within 12-15. We\'ll set: if age<30 =>13, else 13 - (age-30)*0.05 => at 70 => 11.0.\n\nhematocrit: hemoglobin*3 => approximate.\n\nMCV: 90 constant.\n\nMCH: 30 constant.\n\nMCHC: 34 constant.\n\nRBC: 4.5 constant.\n\nplatelets: 250 constant.\n\nwbc: 6 constant.\n\nhs_crp: 0.3 + age*0.005 (increase) capped at 5.\n\nferritin: 80 - age*0.3 (decline) min 15.\n\ntransferrin: 2.5 constant.\n\ntransferrin_saturation: 30 constant.\n\nesr: 10 + age*0.1 (increase) cap 30.\n\nil6: 2 + age*0.02 (increase) cap 10.\n\ntnf: 5 + age*0.02 (increase) cap 15.\n\ncreatinine: 50 + age*0.2 (increase) max 90.\n\negfr: 120 - age*0.5 (decrease) min 60.\n\nurea: 5 constant.\n\nproteinuria: 10 constant.\n\nast: 20 constant.\n\nalt: 20 constant.\n\nggt: 25 constant.\n\nalkaline_phosphatase: 70 + age*0.2 (increase) max 120.\n\ntotal_protein: 70 constant.\n\nalbumin: 40 constant.\n\nglobulins: 25 constant.\n\ntotal_cholesterol: 5 - age*0.01 (decrease) min 3.\n\nhdl_cholesterol: 1.5 + age*0.005 (increase) max 2.5.\n\nldl_cholesterol: 3 - age*0.01 (decrease) min 2.\n\nnon_hdl_cholesterol: total - hdl.\n\ntriglycerides: 1 - age*0.005 (decrease) min 0.5.\n\napolipoprotein_a1: 1.3 constant.\n\napolipoprotein_b: 0.9 constant.\n\nhomocysteine: 8 + age*0.05 (increase) max 15.\n\ntsh: 2 constant.\n\nft4: 16 constant.\n\nft3: 5 constant.\n\nestradiol: premenopause high, postmenopause low.

Actually albumin 40, total protein 70. We\'ll set 55.\n\nlipoprotein_particle_indices: 5 constant.\n\nesr_crp: maybe same as esr and hs_crp? We\'ll set hs_crp*10? but numeric.\n\nWe\'ll set esr_crp = esr + hs_crp*10.\n\nbioage: maybe equal to age +/- some offset based on risk factors. We\'ll set bioage = age + 2 (since heavy alcohol). But cap at 100.\n\nNow we need to generate rows for age 0 to, say, 78 (realistic). Let\'s pick death age 78.\n\nThus 79 rows.\n\nWe must compute each column for each age.\n\nLet\'s create header with all columns in order.\n\nWe\'ll need to compute formulas for each age. This is a lot but we can generate programmatically in mind? Might be time-consuming but we can produce approximate values.\n\nSimplify: we can produce same values for many ages (constant) to reduce variation, but still need numeric. That is acceptable.\n\nWe can produce values that are independent of age for most biomarkers, only age-dependent ones we compute using simple formulas.\n\nLet\'s compute for a few ages and then maybe pattern repeats? But each row must have numeric values; they can be same each row for many columns (like constant). That\'s okay.\n\nThus we need to compute weight and height varying per age; other variables we can set constant or simple linear.\n\nWe\'ll create a table with age from 0 to 78.\n\nWe\'ll compute weight using simpler: weight = 3.5 + age*0.7 (approx). At age 0:3.5, age 10:10.5, age 20:17.5, age 40:31.5, age 78:58.1. That\'s plausible.\n\nHeight: height = 50 + age*1.5 (capped at 165). At age 0:50, age 30:95, age 70:155, age 78:167 (capped 165). Let\'s use min(height,165). So height = min(50 + age*1.5, 165). Good.\n\nNow compute other values.\n\nWe\'ll need to compute each column per age formula.\n\nLet\'s define functions:\n\nmenopause: if age<45 => -1; if 45<=age<=50 =>0; else =>1.\n\nhormonal_contraception: if menopause==-1 and 20<=age<=35 =>1 else -1 (or 0 if menopause==1). So if menopause==-1 and age between 20-35 =>1 else -1.\n\npregnancy: if age<15 =>0 else 3.\n\nglucose: 4.0 + age*0.01 (max 7? but okay). At age78 => 4.78.\n\ninsulin: 5 + age*0.05 (max 20). Age78 => 5+3.9=8.9.\n\nhba1c: 4.5 + age*0.02 (max maybe 6). Age78 => 6.06 (slightly >6). okay.\n\nhemoglobin: if age<30 =>13 else 13 - (age-30)*0.05. At age78 =>13 -48*0.05=13-2.4=10.6 (below normal but okay). We\'ll compute each.\n\nhematocrit = hemoglobin*3 (approx). So 13*3=39 etc.\n\nmean_corpuscular_volume: 90 constant.\n\nmean_corpuscular_hemoglobin: 30 constant.\n\nmean_corpuscular_hemoglobin_concentration: 34 constant.\n\nred_blood_cell_count: 4.5 constant.\n\nplatelets: 250 constant.\n\nwbc: 6 constant.\n\nhs_crp: 0.3 + age*0.005. Age78 =>0.3+0.39=0.69.\n\nferritin: 80 - age*0.3, min 15. Age78 =>80-23.4=56.6.\n\ntransferrin: 2.5.\n\ntransferrin_saturation: 30.\n\nesr: 10 + age*0.1 (capped maybe 30).

We need to include each column exactly once. The prompt includes many columns but some are repeated; we should include unique ones. Let\'s compile a list:\n\nFrom Demographics:\nage, weight, height, menopause, hormonal_contraception, pregnancy\n\nBlood biomarkers categories:\n\nEnergy metabolism:\nglucose, insulin, hba1c\n\nOxygenation/Hematology:\nhemoglobin, Hematocrit, mean_corpuscular_volume, mean_corpuscular_hemoglobin, mean_corpuscular_hemoglobin_concentration, red_blood_cell_count, platelets\n\nImmunity & Inflammation:\nwbc, hs_crp, ferritin, transferrin, transferrin_saturation, esr, il6, tNF\n\nKidney function:\ncreatinine, eGFR, urea, proteinuria\n\nLiver function:\nast, alt, ggt, alkaline_phosphatase, total_protein, albumin, globulins\n\nLipids & cardiovascular markers:\ntotal_cholesterol, hdl_cholesterol, ldl_cholesterol, non_hdl_cholesterol, triglycerides, apolipoprotein_a1, apolipoprotein_b, homocysteine\n\nThyroid:\ntsh, fT4, fT3\n\nReproductive & sex hormones:\nestradiol, testosterone, lh, fsh, prolactin, amh, 17_oh_progesterone\n\nStress/Adrenal:\ncortisol, dhea_s, cortisol_dhea_ratio\n\nVitamins & B-vitamins:\nvitamin_d, folate, vitamin_b12, vitamin_b1, vitamin_b6, vitamin_c\n\nMinerals & electrolytes:\ncalcium, magnesium, potassium, sodium, zinc, selenium, iron\n\nMuscle / Liver-muscle damage & recovery:\ncreatine_kinase, ast_alt (but ast already, alt already; maybe skip duplicate), urea_bun (duplicate), albumin_total_protein (duplicate)\n\nMiscellaneous / advanced markers:\napolipoprotein_a1 (duplicate), apolipoprotein_b (duplicate), lipoprotein_particle_indices, homocysteine (duplicate), amh (duplicate), esr_crp (duplicate)\n\nTarget:\nbioage\n\nThus we need to decide final set. To avoid duplication, we can include each column once.

For age 0 (infant) many adult biomarkers unrealistic. But we can generate plausible pediatric ranges maybe, but not required to be medically accurate. Provide numeric values. Could use simple functions: weight increase with age, height increase, etc. For biomarkers we can set typical adult values for ages >= 20, and for younger ages we can set plausible values albeit maybe similar. Simpler: generate random values within typical ranges for each column, but ensure some age trends (e.g., menopause 0 until age ~51 then 1). Hormonal contraception - perhaps 0 for all ages, or -1? Should be 1/ -1 /0. Since never used hormonal contraception? Not specified. Could set -1 (No). Pregnancy: Not applicable for ages <12; set 4 (Not applicable). For ages where could be pregnant, set 4 as not applicable because children total 0, but could be 4 always.\n\nMenopause: set -1 until age 52 then 1 after. At age 0-51: -1. At 52+: 1.\n\nHormonal_contraception: -1 for all ages (No).\n\nNow generate weight and height: Use simple linear growth: weight = 3.5 + age*2 (kg) for age 0-20, then adult weight ~ 65 kg after 20. We\'ll clamp at 65. Height: 50 cm at birth, increase 5 cm per year until 150 at age 20, then 160 at adult. Use simple piecewise.\n\nFor biomarkers: Use typical adult ranges for ages >=18, and for younger ages we can use same ranges but may be okay.\n\nWe need to produce rows for ages 0 to maybe 84 (realistic). Choose death age 84.\n\nNow need to generate numeric values for each column for each age. Could use random but consistent? We can generate deterministic approximate values using simple formulas or random seeds. But must produce a long CSV with 85 rows (0-84). That\'s a lot of data. Need to output all rows.\n\nGiven time constraints, we can produce a simplified dataset: assign same value for most biomarkers across ages, maybe slight variation with age. That\'s okay.\n\nLet\'s define functions:\n\n- glucose: 5.0 mmol/L for all ages, slight random +/-0.2.\n- insulin: 10 µIU/mL.\n- hba1c: 5.2 %\n- hemoglobin: 13.5 g/dL\n- Hematocrit: 40%\n- MCV: 90 fL\n- MCH: 30 pg\n- MCHC: 34 g/dL\n- RBC: 4.5 10^12/L\n- platelets: 250 10^9/L\n- wbc: 7.0 10^9/L\n- hs_crp: 0.3 mg/L\n- ferritin: 80 µg/L\n- transferrin: 2.8 g/L\n- transferrin_saturation: 30%\n- esr: 10 mm/h (increase with age: add 0.1*age)\n- il6: 2 pg/mL\n- tNF: 5 pg/mL\n- creatinine: 70 µmol/L (increase with age: +0.3*age)\n- eGFR: 100 - 0.5*age (min 30)\n- urea: 5 mmol/L\n- proteinuria: 10 mg/g\n- ast: 20 U/L\n- alt: 25 U/L\n- ggt: 15 U/L\n- alkaline_phosphatase: 80 U/L (decrease with age)\n- total_protein: 70 g/L\n- albumin: 40 g/L\n- globulins: 25 g/L\n- total_cholesterol: 4.5 mmol/L (increase after 30)\n- hdl_cholesterol: 1.5 mmol/L\n- ldl_cholesterol: 2.5 mmol/L\n- non_hdl_cholesterol: total - hdl = 3.0\n- triglycerides: 1.0 mmol/L\n- apolipoprotein_a1: 1.3 g/L\n- apolipoprotein_b: 0.9 g/L\n- homocysteine: 10 µmol/L\n- tsh: 2.0 mU/L\n- fT4: 15 pmol/L\n- fT3: 5 pmol/L\n- estradiol: for premenopausal ages 20-45: 150 pg/mL; postmenopausal: 20 pg/mL; for children: 10.\n- testosterone: 1.0 nmol/L\n- lh: premenopausal 8 IU/L; post: 30 IU/L; children 2.\n- fsh: premenopausal 7 IU/L; post: 60 IU/L; children 3.\n- prolactin: 10 ng/mL\n- amh: premenopausal 3 ng/mL; post: 0.5; children 1.\n- 17_oh_progesterone: 1 ng/mL\n- cortisol: 400 nmol/L (decrease with age)\n- dhea_s: 200 µg/dL (decrease with age)\n- cortisol_dhea_ratio: cortisol/dhea_s (unitless) compute approx 2.0\n- vitamin_d: 40 ng/mL (decline with age)\n- folate: 8 ng/mL\n- vitamin_b12: 500 pg/mL\n- vitamin_b1: 60 µg/L\n- vitamin_b6: 8 µg/L\n- vitamin_c: 50 µmol/L\n- calcium: 2.4 mmol/L\n- magnesium: 0.9 mmol/L\n- potassium: 4.5 mmol/L\n- sodium: 140 mmol/L\n- zinc: 90 µg/dL\n- selenium: 100 µg/L\n- iron: 100 µg/dL\n- creatine_kinase: 100 U/L\n- lipoprotein_particle_indices: 5 (unitless)\n- bioage: could be equal to age +/- small offset (e.g., age -2 for younger, age+5 for older). Use formula: bioage = age + (age>50? 5 : -2). Ensure within 0-100.\n\nWe need to generate rows for ages 0-84. For each age, compute values based on formulas.\n\nLet\'s compute some formulas:\n\nWeight:\nif age <= 2: weight = 3.5 + age*2 (kg) (0->3.5, 1->5.5, 2->7.5)\nif age <= 20: weight = 7.5 + (age-2)*2.5 (approx). At age 20 weight = 7.5 + 18*2.5 = 7.5+45=52.5 kg\nif age >20: weight = 65 kg (adult). Could add slight variation: weight = 65 + (age-50)*0.2 (increase slight after 50). Let\'s just keep 65.\n\nHeight:\nif age <= 2: height = 50 + age*12 (0->50,1->62,2->74)\nif age <= 20: height = 74 + (age-2)*5 (so 20->74+18*5=164 cm)\nif age >20: height = 164 cm, maybe +0.2*(age-20) up to 170 at 80. Let\'s keep 164.\n\nMenopause:\nif age<52: -1 else 1.\n\nHormonal_contraception: -1 for all ages (since never used? Actually not given; we can set -1).\n\nPregnancy: Not applicable (4) for all ages (since no children). but for child ages maybe 4.\n\nNow compute age-dependent values:\n\nesr = 10 + 0.1*age\n\ncreatinine = 70 + 0.3*age (max maybe 100). At age 84: 70+25.2=95.2.\n\neGFR = max(30, 100 - 0.5*age). At age 0: 100. At 84: 100-42=58.\n\nalkaline_phosphatase = 80 - 0.3*age (min 30). At 84: 80-25.2=54.8.\n\ntotal_cholesterol = 4.5 + 0.02*max(0, age-30). So increases after 30.\n\nhdl constant 1.5.\n\nldl constant 2.5.\n\nnon_hdl = total - hdl.\n\ntriglycerides = 1.0 + 0.01*max(0, age-30).\n\nestradiol:\nif age<12: 10\nelif age<52: 150\nelse: 20\n\ntestosterone constant 1.0\n\nlh:\nif age<12: 2\nelif age<52: 8\nelse: 30\n\nfsh:\nif age<12: 3\nelif age<52: 7\nelse: 60\n\namh:\nif age<12: 1\nelif age<52: 3\nelse: 0.5\n\ncortisol: 400 - 1*age (so at 84: 316). keep >150.\n\ndhea_s: 200 - 1.5*age (at 84: 200-126=74). keep >35.\n\ncortisol_dhea_ratio = cortisol / dhea_s (unitless). Compute.\n\nvitamin_d: 40 - 0.2*age (min 20). At 84: 40-16.8=23.2.\n\nbioage:\nif age<30: age - 2 (min 0)\nelif age<=50: age\nelse: age + 5 (max 100). Ensure cap.\n\nNow generate CSV.\n\nNeed to ensure numeric values with maybe 2 decimal places.\n\nLet\'s compute for each age 0-84.\n\nWill produce header line with all column names.\n\nI need to generate rows manually? Could script mentally but many rows. Perhaps produce a pattern with formulas but need explicit values. That\'s a lot (85 rows). Might be acceptable to output a simplified pattern but need actual numbers for each row.\n\nGiven limited time, I can generate rows with approximate values using formulas but manually maybe produce first few rows and then indicate ellipsis? No, must output full CSV with all rows. Must be accurate.\n\nWe can try to produce rows quickly using reasoning but it\'s long. However as AI, I can generate programmatically in my mind but it\'s tedious. I could produce a concise representation? The instruction: "Output ONLY the CSV content." Might accept large output.\n\nLet\'s attempt to generate values using formulas. I\'ll compute for each age step.\n\nI\'ll create columns list:\n\nage,weight,height,menopause,hormonal_contraception,pregnancy,glucose,insulin,hba1c,hemoglobin,Hematocrit,mean_corpuscular_volume,mean_corpuscular_hemoglobin,mean_corpuscular_hemoglobin_concentration,red_blood_cell_count,platelets,wbc,hs_crp,ferritin,transferrin,transferrin_saturation,esr,il6,tNF,creatinine,eGFR,urea,proteinuria,ast,alt,ggt,alkaline_phosphatase,total_protein,albumin,globulins,total_cholesterol,hdl_cholesterol,ldl_cholesterol,non_hdl_cholesterol,triglycerides,apolipoprotein_a1,apolipoprotein_b,homocysteine,tsh,fT4,fT3,estradiol,testosterone,lh,fsh,prolactin,amh,17_oh_progesterone,cortisol,dhea_s,cortisol_dhea_ratio,vitamin_d,folate,vitamin_b12,vitamin_b1,vitamin_b6,vitamin_c,calcium,magnesium,potassium,sodium,zinc,selenium,iron,creatine_kinase,lipoprotein_particle_indices,bioage\n\nNow compute for each age.\n\nI\'ll produce values with 2 decimals.\n\nI\'ll create helper mental calculations:\n\nWeight:\nIf age<=2:\nage0: 3.5\nage1: 5.5\nage2: 7.5\nIf 3-20: weight = 7.5 + (age-2)*2.5\nSo age3: 7.5+1*2.5=10.0\nage4: 12.5\n5:15.0\n6:17.5\n7:20.0\n8:22.5\n9:25.0\n10:27.5\n11:30.0\n12:32.5\n13:35.0\n14:37.5\n15:40.0\n16:42.5\n17:45.0\n18:47.5\n19:50.0\n20:52.5\n>20: 65.0 (maybe keep constant)\n\nHeight:\nage0:50\nage1:62\nage2:74\nage3:74+1*5=79\n4:84\n5:89\n6:94\n7:99\n8:104\n9:109\n10:114\n11:119\n12:124\n13:129\n14:134\n15:139\n16:144\n17:149\n18:154\n19:159\n20:164\n>'))], created=1763835219, model='openai/gpt-oss-120b', object='chat.completion', service_tier=None, system_fingerprint=None, usage=CompletionUsage(completion_tokens=4132, prompt_tokens=3325, total_tokens=7457, completion_tokens_details=None, prompt_tokens_details=None))
